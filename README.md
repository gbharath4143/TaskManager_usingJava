Task Manager Application

Description:
The Task Manager Application is a simple Java program that allows users to manage their tasks effectively. Users can add tasks with titles, descriptions, and due dates, list all tasks, mark tasks as completed, and remove tasks from the task list.

Files:
1. Main.java - Contains the main class with the application's menu and user interface.
2. Task.java - Defines the Task class with fields and methods to represent individual tasks.
3. TaskManager.java - Implements the TaskManager class, which manages tasks and provides methods to add, remove, list, mark as completed, and perform other operations on tasks.

How to Use:
1. Compile the Java files using a Java compiler (e.g., javac Main.java Task.java TaskManager.java).
2. Run the Main class (e.g., java Main) to start the Task Manager Application.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to perform various tasks such as adding tasks, listing tasks, marking tasks as completed, removing tasks, and exiting the application.
4. Input data according to the prompts displayed on the screen.

Functionality:
1. Add Task - Allows users to add a new task to the task list by providing a title, description, and due date.
2. List Tasks - Displays a list of all tasks currently stored in the task manager along with their details.
3. Mark Task as Completed - Enables users to mark a specific task as completed by entering its index from the task list.
4. Remove Task - Allows users to remove a task from the task list by entering its index.
5. Exit - Exits the Task Manager Application.
